THIS APPRAISAL REPORT IS BASED ON A TYPICAL APPRAISAL INSPECTION, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REASONABLE
SUBSTITUTE FOR A BUILDING INSPECTION. THE PURPOSE OF AN APPRAISAL INSPECTION IS TO ASSIST THE APPRAISER IN
DEVELOPING THE ESTIMATE OF VALUE; TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE DWELLING MEETS MINIMUM PROPERTY STANDARDS (FHA/HUD)
AND TO DETERMINE MARKETABILITY AND VALUE.
A HOME INSECTION IS A DETAILED IN-DEPTH INSPECTION BY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL. IT'S PURPOSE IS TO EVALUATE THE
PHYSICAL CONDITION OF SPECIFIC COMPONENTS INCLUDING OVERALL CONSTRUCTION, STRUCTURAL, INTEGRITY AND
MECHANICAL SYSTEMS; TO IDENTIFY THE EXISTANCE OF DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS IN NEED OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT; TO
ESTIMATE THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF A MAJOR SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS INCLUDING MECHANICAL,STRUCTURAL AND
FINISHES.
THIS APPRAISAL IS NOT A HOME INSPECTION AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON TO REPORT THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY
BEING APPRAISED. IT SHOULD BE EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE APPRAISER IS NOT AN ENGINEER OR A TRAINED HOME
INSPECTOR AND THEREFORE URGES THE BUYER TO EXERCISE HIS OR HER RIGHT TO A FULL HOME INSPECTION BY A QUALIFIED
HOME INSPECTOR.
At the request of the client, this appraisal report has been prepared in compliance with the UAD (Uniform Appraisal Dataset) from Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. The UAD requires the appraiser to select standardized responses that include specific formats, definitions, abbreviations, and
acronyms. The appraiser attempted to obtain an adequate amount of information in the normal course of business regarding the subject and
comparable properties. Some of the standardized responses required by the UAD, especially those in which the appraiser has not had the
opportunity to verify personally or measure, could mistakenly imply greater precision and reliability in the data than is factually correct or typical in
the normal course of business. Examples include condition and quality ratings, as well as comparable sales and listing data. Not every element of
subject property was viewable and comparable property data was generally obtained from third party sources (i.e, MLS, realtors when available, tax
assessor records, etc). Consequently, this information should be considered an "estimate" unless otherwise noted by the appraiser
WE HAVE NOT COMPLETED ANY PRIOR APPRAISALS ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 3 YEARS.
ESTIMATED MARKETING TIME FOR THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IS 90-180 DAYS.

Uniform Residential Appraisal Report File #
This report form is designed to report an appraisal of a one-unit property or a one-unit property with an accessory unit;
including a unit in a planned unit development (PUD). This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a
manufactured home or a unit in a condominium or cooperative project.
This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value,
statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended
use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may
expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal
assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do
not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's
continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted.
SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the
reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of
assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual
inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, (2) inspect the neighborhood, (3) inspect each of the
comparable sales from at least the street, (4) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private sources,
and (5) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report.
INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the
subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction.
INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client.
DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open
market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming
the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and
the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both
parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a
reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms
of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold
unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.
*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are
necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are
readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing
adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional
lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical
dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's
reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.
STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is
subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions:
1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title
to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. The
appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title.
2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements.
The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination
of its size.
3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an
identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or
implied, regarding this determination.
4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question,
unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law.
5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or
she became aware of during the research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal
report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the
property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances,
adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such
conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such
conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist.
Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as
an environmental assessment of the property.
6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory
completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will
be performed in a professional manner.

for this appraisal assignment. I further certify that I considered the cost and income approaches to value but did not develop
them, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
5. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on any current agreement for sale for the subject property, any offering for
sale of the subject property in the twelve months prior to the effective date of this appraisal, and the prior sales of the subject
property for a minimum of three years prior to the effective date of this appraisal, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
6. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on the prior sales of the comparable sales for a minimum of one year prior
to the date of sale of the comparable sale, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
7. I selected and used comparable sales that are locationally, physically, and functionally the most similar to the subject property.
8. I have not used comparable sales that were the result of combining a land sale with the contract purchase price of a home that
has been built or will be built on the land.
9. I have reported adjustments to the comparable sales that reflect the market's reaction to the differences between the subject
property and the comparable sales.
10. I verified, from a disinterested source, all information in this report that was provided by parties who have a financial interest in
the sale or financing of the subject property.
11. I have knowledge and experience in appraising this type of property in this market area.
12. I am aware of, and have access to, the necessary and appropriate public and private data sources, such as multiple listing
services, tax assessment records, public land records and other such data sources for the area in which the property is located.

reliable sources that I believe to be true and correct.
14. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value with respect to the subject neighborhood, subject
property, and the proximity of the subject property to adverse influences in the development of my opinion of market value. I
have noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the

present owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property or on any other basis prohibited by law.
18. My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not
conditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a
predetermined specific value, a predetermined minimum value, a range or direction in value, a value that favors the cause of
any party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending
mortgage loan application).

Condition Ratings and Definitions
C1
The improvements have been very recently constructed and have not previously been occupied. The entire structure and all components are new
and the dwelling features no physical depreciation.*
*Note: Newly constructed improvements that feature recycled materials and/or components can be considered new dwellings provided that the
dwelling is placed on a 100% new foundation and the recycled materials and the recycled components have been rehabilitated/re-manufactured
into like-new condition. Recently constructed improvements that have not been previously occupied are not considered “new” if they have any
significant physical depreciation (i.e., newly constructed dwellings that have been vacant for an extended period of time without adequate
maintenance or upkeep).
C2
The improvements feature no deferred maintenance, little or no physical depreciation, and require no repairs. Virtually all building components
are new or have been recently repaired, refinished, or rehabilitated. All outdated components and finishes have been updated and/or replaced
with components that meet current standards. Dwellings in this category either are almost new or have been recently completely renovated and
are similar in condition to new construction.
C3
The improvements are well maintained and feature limited physical depreciation due to normal wear and tear. Some components, but not every
major building component, may be updated or recently rehabilitated. The structure has been well maintained.
C4
The improvements feature some minor deferred maintenance and physical deterioration due to normal wear and tear. The dwelling has been
adequately maintained and requires only minimal repairs to building components/mechanical systems and cosmetic repairs. All major building
components have been adequately maintained and are functionally adequate.
C5
The improvements feature obvious deferred maintenance and are in need of some significant repairs. Some building components need repairs,
rehabilitation, or updating. The functional utility and overall livability is somewhat diminished due to condition, but the dwelling remains
useable and functional as a residence.
C6
The improvements have substantial damage or deferred maintenance with deficiencies or defects that are severe enough to affect the safety,
soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements. The improvements are in need of substantial repairs and rehabilitation, including many
or most major components.
Quality Ratings and Definitions
Q1
Dwellings with this quality rating are usually unique structures that are individually designed by an architect for a specified user. Such
residences typically are constructed from detailed architectural plans and specifications and feature an exceptionally high level of workmanship
and exceptionally high-grade materials throughout the interior and exterior of the structure. The design features exceptionally high-quality
exterior refinements and ornamentation, and exceptionally high-quality interior refinements. The workmanship, materials, and finishes
throughout the dwelling are of exceptionally high quality.
Q2
Dwellings with this quality rating are often custom designed for construction on an individual property owner’s site. However, dwellings in
this quality grade are also found in high-quality tract developments featuring residence constructed from individual plans or from highly
modified or upgraded plans. The design features detailed, high quality exterior ornamentation, high-quality interior refinements, and detail. The
workmanship, materials, and finishes throughout the dwelling are generally of high or very high quality.
Q3
Dwellings with this quality rating are residences of higher quality built from individual or readily available designer plans in above-standard
residential tract developments or on an individual property owner’s site. The design includes significant exterior ornamentation and interiors
that are well finished. The workmanship exceeds acceptable standards and many materials and finishes throughout the dwelling have been
upgraded from “stock” standards.
Q4
Dwellings with this quality rating meet or exceed the requirements of applicable building codes. Standard or modified standard building plans
are utilized and the design includes adequate fenestration and some exterior ornamentation and interior refinements. Materials, workmanship,
finish, and equipment are of stock or builder grade and may feature some upgrades.

(Source: Fannie Mae UAD Appendix D: UAD Field-Specific Standardization Requirements)
Quality Ratings and Definitions (continued)
Q5
Dwellings with this quality rating feature economy of construction and basic functionality as main considerations. Such dwellings feature a
plain design using readily available or basic floor plans featuring minimal fenestration and basic finishes with minimal exterior ornamentation
and limited interior detail. These dwellings meet minimum building codes and are constructed with inexpensive, stock materials
with limited refinements and upgrades.
Q6
Dwellings with this quality rating are of basic quality and lower cost; some may not be suitable for year-round occupancy. Such dwellings
are often built with simple plans or without plans, often utilizing the lowest quality building materials. Such dwellings are often built or
expanded by persons who are professionally unskilled or possess only minimal construction skills. Electrical, plumbing, and other mechanical
systems and equipment may be minimal or non-existent. Older dwellings may feature one or more substandard or non-conforming additions
to the original structure
Definitions of Not Updated, Updated, and Remodeled
Not Updated
Little or no updating or modernization. This description includes, but is not limited to, new homes.
Residential properties of fifteen years of age or less often reflect an original condition with no updating, if no major
components have been replaced or updated. Those over fifteen years of age are also considered not updated if the
appliances, fixtures, and finishes are predominantly dated. An area that is ‘Not Updated’ may still be well maintained
and fully functional, and this rating does not necessarily imply deferred maintenance or physical/functional deterioration.
Updated
The area of the home has been modified to meet current market expectations. These modifications
are limited in terms of both scope and cost.
An updated area of the home should have an improved look and feel, or functional utility. Changes that constitute
updates include refurbishment and/or replacing components to meet existing market expectations. Updates do not
include significant alterations to the existing structure.
Remodeled
Significant finish and/or structural changes have been made that increase utility and appeal through
complete replacement and/or expansion.
A remodeled area reflects fundamental changes that include multiple alterations. These alterations may include
some or all of the following: replacement of a major component (cabinet(s), bathtub, or bathroom tile), relocation
of plumbing/gas fixtures/appliances, significant structural alterations (relocating walls, and/or the addition of)
square footage). This would include a complete gutting and rebuild.
Explanation of Bathroom Count
Three-quarter baths are counted as a full bath in all cases.  Quarter baths (baths that feature only a toilet) are not
included in the bathroom count.  The number of full and half baths is reported by separating the two values using a
period, where the full bath count is represented to the left of the period and the half bath count is represented to the
right of the period.
Example:
3.2 indicates three full baths and two half baths.
